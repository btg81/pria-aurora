      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        Our Dream &amp; Breakfast overlooks the sea, nestled among the cliffs of Pegli.  
        A strategic and unique location: next to the bus stop, close to the train station and the pier from which the ferry takes you directly to the Old Port of Genoa.  
        Yet, once you cross the threshold, the world seems to stop, silence begins and your land-cruise sets sail.  
        In a cozy setting, below street level, with the cliffs at your back and the infinite blue in front, the only sound that reaches the window is that of the waves caressing the shore.  
        A retreat suspended between comfort and poetry, where the sea sets the rhythm of the days.
